Colorball is a website which is home to two games: Colorball Classic and Hyperball. Colorball Classic is a brick breaker style game with a twist: the player controls two back-to-back games divided by a barrier which, when hit, reduces the playerâ€™s score. The player must destroy all the bricks before time is up, and avoid hitting the barrier as much as possible! Hyperball is a game which puts the player in control of the deadly  barrier, and the player must see how many bounces he can allow the ball to have before it hits the barrier and the game ends!
